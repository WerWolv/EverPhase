- [Eclipse for Java developers](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/Oxygen/M4)
- [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/?fromMenu#chooseYourEdition), used by the developers
- [NetBeans](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk-netbeans-jsp-142931.html)
- [Java SDK / JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html), Warning: tricky to build projects!

Please note that the CMake support is not done yet. You will need to bundle the jar libraries manually.
